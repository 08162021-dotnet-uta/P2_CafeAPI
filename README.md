# P2_CafeAPI
## Project Description
This is a ASP.NET Core API project utilizing Entity Framework Core, an Azure SQL Database, and Angular front-end to create a Web Store Application. Store items are provided by the Rainforest API, which uses AI-powered visual page inspection to extract information from Amazon web pages. The general idea of the project was to mimic Amazon. We identified the most crucial features and set about implementing them.
